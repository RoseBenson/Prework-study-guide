# Prework-study-guide-webpage

## Description

My motivation to make to guide, was to make it easier to study the prework in this course, I created a prework study guide that enables me to be able to work and study more sufficiently.
I built this project, so as I go along y studies I am able to refer to the guide, when I am stuck or need help, at any point during my studies and to help other students who may also need help.
This guide solves the problem of being stuck on a something during the study process and need help to jog your memory.
I learnt how to use the programming languages, HTML, CSS, Javascript and API'S.
